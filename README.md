# Get Started with Microsoft Azure IoT Starter Kit - Raspberry Pi 2

This page contains technical information to help you get familiar with Azure IoT using the Azure IoT Starter Kit - Raspberry Pi 2. You will find two tutorials that will walk you through different scenarios: the first tutorial will show you how to connect your Azure IoT Starter kit to our Remote Monitoring preconfigured solution from Azure IoT Suite. In the second tutorial, you will leverage Azure IoT services to create your own IoT architecture.

You can choose to start with whichever tutorial you want to. If you've never worked with Azure IoT services before, we encourage you to start with the Remote Monitoring solution tutorial, because all of the Azure services will be provisioned for you in a built-in preconfigured solution. Then you can explore how each of the services work by going through the second tutorial.

 We hope you enjoy the process. Please provide feedback if there's anything that we can improve.

## 1.1 Tutorial Overview

In this tutorial, you'll be doing the following:
- Setting up your environment on Azure using the Microsoft Azure IoT Suite Remote Monitoring preconfigured solution, getting a large portion of the set-up that would be required done in one step.
- Setting your device and sensors up so that it can communicate with both your computer, and Azure IoT. 
- Updating the device code sample to include our connection data and send it to Azure IoT to be viewed remotely.

## 1.2 Before Starting

### 1.2.1 Required Software

- An SSH client – This makes it so you can remotely access the Raspberry Pi’s command line remotely from your computer
  - Windows doesn’t have a built-in SSH client. We recommend using [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/)
  - Many Linux distributions and Mac OS has SSH built into their terminal. If yours does not, we recommend OpenSSH
  - See also: [SSH Using Linux of Mac OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/unix.md)

### 1.2.2 Required Hardware

- Microsoft Azure IoT Starter Kit
  - 8GB MicroSD Card (Comes with the kit, flashed with Windows 10 IoT Core)
  - A USB Mini cable (Comes with the kit)

## 1.3 Create a New Azure IoT Suite Remote Monitoring solution and Add Device

- Log in to [Azure IoT Suite](https://www.azureiotsuite.com/)  with your Microsoft account and click **Create a New Preconfigured Solution** 

***
**Note:** Creating an account is free. Click here to get your [Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/)
***

- Click select in the **Remote Monitoring** option
- Type in a solution name. For this tutorial we’ll be using “Pi2Suite”
- Choose your subscription plan and geographic region, then click **Create Solution**
- Wait for Azure to finish provisioning your IoT suite (this process may take up to 10 minutes), and then click **Launch**

***
**Note:** You may be asked to log back in. This is to ensure your solution has proper permissions associated with your account. 
***

- Open the link to your IoT Suite’s “Solution Dashboard.” You may have been redirected there already. 
- This opens your personal remote monitoring site at the URL &lt;Your IoT Hub suite name>.azurewebsites.net (e.g. Pi2Suite.azurewebsites.net)
- Click **Add a Device** at the lower left hand corner of your screen
- Add a new **custom device**
- Enter your desired device ID. In this case we’ll use “RaspPi”, and then click **Create**
- Make note of your device ID, Device Key, and IoT Hub Hostname to enter into the code you’ll run on your device later 

***
**Note:** The Remote Monitoring solution provisions a set of Azure IoT Services in your Azure account. To avoid unnecessary consumption, you may want to **stop** your remote monitoring solution while you are working on the next steps. 
***

##1.4 Prepare the Device

If this is the first time you are using Raspberry Pi 2, now it’s the time to set it up. If you’ll be using Windows, please use [windowsondevices.com](http://www.windowsondevices.com/) for detail
guidelines on how to get started with the Raspberry Pi. If you’re using Linux, Raspberry Pi and Adafruit have a set of tutorials and videos to help you get started.

| Pin 15E                 | Pin 21E                | BME280        |

**At the end of your work, your Raspberry Pi should be connected with a working sensor.**

### 1.4.1 Log in and Access the Terminal

The default login for Raspbian is username `pi` with password `raspberry`. In the task bar up top, you can launch the Terminal using the 3rd icon from the left – The one that looks like a monitor. This is where you will be entering commands if you use the Raspbian interface directly.

### 1.4.2 Log in Using PuTTY

- You need to discover the IP address of your Raspberry Pi before you can connect using PuTTY. Type `ip a` in a command prompt to discover your IP. For more information see: [https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ip-address.md](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ip-address.md)
- With the Raspberry Pi on and running, open an SSH terminal program such as [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) on your desktop machine.
- Use the IP address from previous step as the Host Name, Port=22, and Connection type=SSH to complete the connection.
- When prompted, log in with username `pi`, and password `raspberry`.

#### 1.4.2.1 Log in using Linux or Mac OS

- See: [SSH Using Linux of Mac OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/unix.md)

## 1.5 Configure the Remote Monitoring device sample

Now we can download the Remote Monitoring device sample, input your device credentials (i.e. your "Connection String") and start sending data from the Pi to our Azure Remote Monitoring solution.

### 1.5.1 Clone repositories

Clone the following repositories and combine them by entering the following commands on your Pi:

```
cd ~
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks.git
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-hub-c-raspberrypi-getstartedkit.git
cp -a iot-hub-c-raspberrypi-getstartedkit/azure-iot-sdks/. azure-iot-sdks/
```

Now, we need to update device connection string

### 1.5.2 Update the Connection String

- Edit the file by entering the following command:

```
nano ~/azure-iot-sdks/c/serializer/samples/remote_monitoring/remote_monitoring.c
```

- Use the arrow keys to navigate to the following lines:

```
static const char* deviceId = "[Device Id]";
static const char* deviceKey = "[Device Key]";
static const char* hubName = "[IoTHub Name]";
static const char* hubSuffix = "[IoTHub Suffix, i.e. azure-devices.net]";
```
- Replace the placeholder with your device and IoT Hub information you created and saved at the beginning of this tutorial. 
- Save and exit with `Control-o, Enter, Control-x`

## 1.6 Build the Modified Sample

Now that you’re exited out of Nano, install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C by issuing the following commands using the terminal (either on the device or through an SSH client like PuTTY):

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install curl libcurl4-openssl-dev uuid-dev uuid g++ make cmake git unzip openjdk-7-jre libssl-dev libncurses-dev subversion gawk
```

- Now go ahead and build the updated sample solution by entering the following:

```
cd ~/azure-iot-sdks/
sudo ~/azure-iot-sdks/c/build_all/linux/setup.sh
chmod +x ~/azure-iot-sdks/c/build_all/linux/build.sh
~/azure-iot-sdks/c/build_all/linux/build.sh
```

- Before running the program we need to enable the SPI drive to install by default at boot.

```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```
- Scroll down and find the line:

```
#dtparam=spi=on
```
- Delete the `#` at the beginning of the line to uncomment it.
- Save and exit with `Control-o`, `Enter`, `Control-x`, then run the command:

```
sudo reboot
```

- Now that everything is compiled, it’s time to run the program. Enter the command:

```
sudo ~/cmake/serializer/samples/remote_monitoring/remote_monitoring
```
If all goes well, you will begin to see data streaming!
Press `ctrl-c` to exit at any time. Below is a sample of the expected command prompt output:

```
IoTHubClient accepted the message for delivery
Humidity = 48.4% Temperature = 23.9*C
Sending sensor value Temperature = 2, Humidity = 1610612736
IoTHubClient accepted the message for delivery
```

## 1.7 View the Sensor Data from the IoT Suite Portal

- Once you have the sample running, visit your dashboard by visiting azureiotsuite.com and clicking “Launch” on your solution
- Make sure the “Device to View” in the upper right is set to your device
- If the demo is running, you should see the graph change as your data updates in real time!

***
**Note:** Make sure to **stop** your remote monitoring solution once you have completed this to avoid unnecesary Azure consumption!

bower install
```

- Open the `config.json` file and replace the information with your project.  See the following for instructions on how to retrieve those values.

    - eventhubName: 
        - Open the [Classic Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com)
        - Open the Service Bus namespace you created earlier
        - Switch to the **EVENT HUBS** page 
        - You can see and copy the name of your event hub from that page
    - ehConnString: 
        - Click on the name of the event hub from above to open it
        - Click on the "CONNECTION INFORMATION" button along the bottom. 
        - From there, click the button to copy the readwrite shared access policy connection string.
    - deviceId:
        - Use the information on the [Manage IoT Hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/doc/manage_iot_hub.md) to retrieve your deviceId using either the Device Explorer or iothub-explorer tools.
    - iotHubConnString: 
        - In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
        - Open the IoT Hub you created previously. 
        - Open the "Settings" blade
        - Click on the "Shared access policies" setting
        - Click on the "service" policy
        - Copy the primary connection string for the policy
    - storageAccountName:
        - In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
        - Open the classic Storage Account you created previously to copy its name
    - storageAccountKey:
        - Click on the name of the storage account above to open it
        - Click the "Settings" button to open the Settings blade
        - Click on the "Keys" setting
        - Click the button next to the "PRIMARY ACCESS KEY" top copy it
    - storageTableName:
        - This must match the name of the table that was used in the Stream Analytics table storage output above.
        - If you used the instructions above, you would have named it ***`TemperatureRecords`*** 
        - If you named it something else, enter the name you used instead.    
        
```
{
    "port": "3000",
    "eventHubName": "event-hub-name",
    "ehConnString": "Endpoint=sb://name.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=readwrite;SharedAccessKey=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa=",
    "deviceId": "iot-hub-device-name",
    "iotHubConnString": "HostName=iot-hub-name.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=service;SharedAccessKey=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa=",
    "storageAcountName": "aaaaaaaaaaa",
    "storageAccountKey": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa==",
    "storageTable": "TemperatureRecords"
} 
```

- Now it is time to run it! Enter the following command:

```
node server.js
```

- You should then see something similar to:

```
app running on http://localhost:3000
client connected
``` 

- Visit the url in your browser and you will see the Node app running!
 
To deploy this project to the cloud using Azure, you can reference [Creating a Node.js web app in Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-nodejs-develop-deploy-mac/).

Next, we will update your device so that it can interact with all the things you just created.

## 2.9 Configure the Command Center device sample

Now we can download the sample solution repos and incorporate the data from the sensors and send it up to our Microsoft Azure Command Center solution.

Clone the repositories by entering the following commands on your Pi:

```
cd ~
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks.git
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-hub-c-raspberrypi-getstartedkit.git
cp -a iot-hub-c-raspberrypi-getstartedkit/azure-iot-sdks/. azure-iot-sdks/
```

Now, we need to update three things:

- Include the required libraries (included in the git repository)
- Include the Device ID
- Update the connection string to use the string we saved above

### 2.9.1 Update the Connection Data

To update the connection data, we need to update the source file. You can edit the file by entering the following command:

```
nano ~/azure-iot-sdks/c/serializer/samples/simplesample_amqp/simplesample_amqp.c
```

- Use the arrow keys to navigate to the following lines:

```
static const char* connectionString = "HostName=<host_name>.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=<device_id>;SharedAccessKey=<device_key>";
```

- Replace the placeholder with your device connection information you gathered at the beginning of this tutorial. 
- Save and exit with `Control-o, Enter, Control-x`

## 2.10 Build the Modified Sample

Now that you’re exited out of Nano, install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C by issuing the following commands using the terminal (either on the device or through an SSH client like PuTTY):

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install curl libcurl4-openssl-dev uuid-dev uuid g++ make cmake git unzip openjdk-7-jre libssl-dev libncurses-dev subversion gawk
```

- Now go ahead and build the updated sample solution by entering the following:

```
cd ~/azure-iot-sdks/
sudo ~/azure-iot-sdks/c/build_all/linux/setup.sh
chmod +x ~/azure-iot-sdks/c/build_all/linux/build.sh
~/azure-iot-sdks/c/build_all/linux/build.sh
```

- Now that everything is compiled, it’s time to run the program. Enter the command:

```
sudo cmake/serializer/samples/simplesample_amqp/simplesample_amqp
```

You will now see data being sent off at regular intervals to
Microsoft Azure. An alert has also been set to go off when it detects the temperature is above 25 degrees celsius (77'F). You can cup your hand around the sensor and blow warm air to raise the temperature and when the alert goes off, you will see the LED you’ve set up turn red!

***
**Note:** If you're in a particuarlly hot or cold room, you may need to adjust the alert temperature specified in [Create a Stream Analytics job to Save Sensor Data in Table Storage and Raise Alerts](#create-a-stream-analytics-job-to-save-iot-data-in-table-storage-and-raise-alerts).
***

Head back and run your Node application and you will see the most
recent updates and any alerts show up there.

***
**Note:** Make sure to **stop** your Command Center jobs in Stream Analytics once you have completed this to avoid unnecesary Azure consumption!
